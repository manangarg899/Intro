          <span>How the Web Works</span>
          <p>
            The web is a bunch of computers that communicate with
            each other. When a person goes to a web page like
            www.google.com, their computer sends a
            <em>HTTP Request</em> to
            a <em>server</em>.
          </p>
          <p>
            The server finds the appropriate HTML document and sends
            it back to the user's computer where a <em>
            web browser</em> interprets the page and displays it on
            the user's screen.

          <span>HTML</span>
          <p>
            HTML stands for <em>Hypertext Markup
            Language.</em> HTML documents form the majority of the
            content on the web.
          </p>
          <p>
            HTML documents contain <em>text
            content</em> which describes "what you see" and
            <em>markup</em> which describes
            "how it looks". <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721/l-3508959201/m-48724340">This
            video</a> gives a good overview.

          <span>Tags and Elements</span>
           <p>
            HTML documents are made of HTML
            <b>elements</b>. When writing HTML, we
            tell browsers the type of each element by using HTML
            <b>tags</b>.

            distinction well.

          <span>Why Computers are Stupid</span>
          <p>
            Computers are stupid because they interpret
            instructions literally. This makes them very
            unforgiving since a small mistake by a
            programmer can cause huge problems in a program.
          </p>

      <div class="concept" id="lesson-1-5">
          <span>Inline vs Block Elements</span>
          <p>
            HTML elements are either <b>inline</b>
            or <b>block</b>. Block elements form
            an "invisible box" around the content inside of them.

          <span>Developer Tools (in the Browser)</span>
          <p>
            HTML elements are either <b>inline</b>
            or <b>block</b>. Block elements form
            an "invisible box" around the content inside of them.
          </p>
        </div>

      <div class="concept" id="lesson-2-2">
          <span>The "tree-like structure" of HTML</span>
          <p>
            The "tree-like structure" comes from the fact that HTML
            elements can have other elements inside of them. You can
            draw this relationship like a family tree. My mother
            had multiple children. So did her mother, and so on...
          </p>
          <p>
            In a browser, this structure shows up as a series
            of nested boxes. There are boxes inside of boxes
            inside of boxes, and so on...
          </p>
        </div>
      <div class="concept" id="lesson-2-3">
          <span>The relationship between indented HTML and boxes</span>
          <p>
            When you read an HTML document as
            <em>text</em>, you see a wave of
            changing indentations going up and down the left side
            of the document. The more indented an element is, the
            more deeply nested its corresponding "box" is.
          </p>
        </div>
      <div class="concept" id="lesson-2-4">
          Text Editors (for programming)
          <p>
            When writing code, programmers use special text editors
            (like Sublime Text for example). These editors make the
            programmer's life easier. For example, some text editors
            will automatically generate a closing HTML tag when you
            write an opening tag.

      <div class="concept" id="lesson-3-1">
          <span>Avoiding Repetition</span>
          <p>
            Avoiding repetition is important for a variety of reasons.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Avoiding Errors:</b> When programmers <em>don't</em> avoid repetition, they will often have to do the same thing over and over. This may mean copy and pasting certain style attributes into many HTML elements or rewriting the same code (sometimes with minor differences) many times. This can lead to errors when the programmer decides to make a change to something. If they don't dilligently make that same change everywhere the repeated code appears, problems will arise.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Consistency:</b> In this web page, I wanted every lesson to look the same. Instead of manually giving each one the same style, I was able to assign each lesson <span class="code">div</span> the same <span class="code">class</span> and then specify the style for that class in only one place! By avoiding repetion, it's now very easy for me to make changes to this style.
          </p>
      </div>
      <div class="concept" id="lesson-3-2">
          <span>CSS</span>
          <p>
            CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets and they give programmers a way to control the style of related HTML elements. This is done by giving similar HTML elements the same <span class="code">class</span> name and then specifying the style that should apply to that class.
